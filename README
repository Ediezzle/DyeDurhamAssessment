# Name Sorter

A simple .NET Core console application that reads a list of names from a text file, sorts them by last name (and given names in case of ties), prints the sorted names to the console, and writes them to a file.

The program can be executed in the following manner:
name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt

You may skip passing the file path argument
